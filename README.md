## Final Project Stat 301-2

## Overview
This project aims to predict the next NBA champion using historical game data, player statistics, and team rankings. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling using classification techniques.

## Repository Structure
- `memos/` – Stores progress memos detailing analysis steps and findings.
- `figures/` – Contains visualizations generated during analysis.
- `tables/` – Holds tables summarizing key data points.
- `data/` – Includes cleaned and raw datasets used for modeling.
- `1_data_exploration.R` – Initial data exploration and cleaning.
- `2_data_preprocessing.R` – Data transformation and feature engineering.
- `3_target_variable.R` – Target variable definition and preparation.
- `nba_team_colors.RData` – NBA team color mappings for visualization.

## Getting Started
To run the analysis:
1. Ensure all datasets are in the `data/` folder.
2. Run `1_data_exploration.R` to explore and clean the data.
3. Execute `2_data_preprocessing.R` for feature engineering.
4. Use `3_target_variable.R` to view low-level, initial modeling with the target variable (will expand on this in Memo 2)
