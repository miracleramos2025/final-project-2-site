## Prediction problem

**Research Objective:** The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that forecasts Airbnb rental prices in New York City. Specifically, I will predict the price of an Airbnb listing based on various features such as location, property type, number of reviews, availability, and host details.

**Prediction Type:** This is a regression problem, where the target variable will be the `price` of an Airbnb listing. The model will be trained using supervised learning techniques.

**Motivation:** As Airbnb continues to be a dominant platform in the short-term rental market, understanding pricing trends is crucial for both hosts and guests. This project allows me to explore machine learning techniques while analyzing factors that contribute to Airbnb pricing in NYC. By predicting prices accurately, I aim to provide insights into market trends and pricing strategies.

## Data source
**Primary Dataset:** The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle: New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data?select=AB_NYC_2019.csv). It contains details about Airbnb listings in NYC for the year 2019, including host information, listing details, location, and pricing metrics.

**Datasets Used:**

  1. `AB_NYC_2019.csv` â€“ Contains information on Airbnb listings, including host details, property characteristics, location, number of reviews, and pricing.

**Description:** 
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of Airbnb activity in NYC, making it suitable for building a model that predicts listing prices based on various factors.

**Variable Types:** <br>

  - **Numerical Variables:** `id`, `host_id`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `price`, `minimum_nights`, `number_of_reviews`, `reviews_per_month`, `calculated_host_listings_count`, and `availability_365` are all numerical variables in the New York City Airbnb Open Data dataset.
  - **Categorical Variables:** `name`, `host_name`, `neighborhood_group`, `neighborhood`, and `room_type` are all categorical variables in the New York City Airbnb Open Data dataset.
  - **Date Variables:** `last_review` is the only date variable in the New York City Airbnb Open Data dataset.

**Missingness** <br>

  - The dataset has an overall missingness percentage of **2.57%**.
  - The `reviews_per_month` column has **10,052** missing values, which corresponds to listings with no reviews.
  - The `last_review` column also has **10,052** missing values, indicating that these listings have never received a review.
  - No missing values were found in critical numeric columns like `price`, `minimum_nights`, and `availability_365`.

**Data Tidying** <br>

  - Fill missing values in `reviews_per_month` with 0 where no reviews exist.
  - Convert `last_review` to a standardized date format.
  - Encode categorical variables like `neighbourhood_group` and `room_type` for modeling.


## Target variable analysis
**Target Variable:** <br>
The primary target variable for this analysis is `price`, a numerical variable representing the nightly cost of an Airbnb listing.

**Univariate Analysis:** <br>
To understand price distributions, I analyzed the range and central tendencies. The distribution shows that most Airbnb prices are concentrated under $200 per night, but there are extreme outliers with very high prices.
