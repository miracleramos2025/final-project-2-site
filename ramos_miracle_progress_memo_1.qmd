## Prediction problem

**Research Objective:** The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that forecasts the next NBA champion. Specifically, I will predict which team is most likely to win the championship based on historical game data, player statistics, and team rankings.

**Prediction Type:** This is a classification problem, where the target variable will be the `NBA champion team` for a given season. The model will be trained using supervised learning techniques.

**Motivation:** I've been getting into the NBA over the past two years and I want to use predictive models to explore future outcomes. This project is a fun way to combine sports analytics with machine learning, diving into team stats, player performances, and season trends. By analyzing past data, I hope to gain insights into what makes a team champions and see how well predictions match real world results.

## Data source
**Primary Dataset:** The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: [NBA Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathanlauga/nba-games?select=teams.csv). It contains historical game results, player statistics, and team rankings.

**Datasets Used:**

  1. `games.csv` – Contains details of NBA games, including team matchups, final scores, and outcomes.
  2. `games_details.csv` – Includes player-level statistics for each game (points, rebounds, assists, etc.).
  3. `ranking.csv` – Provides team rankings over different seasons.
  4. `teams.csv` – Contains metadata about NBA teams.
  5. `nba_champions.csv` – Provides NBA Champions data for the 30 active teams [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/)

## Data quality check

```{r}
#| label: tbl-data-quality-check
#| tbl-cap: "Data Quality Check"
#| echo: false


# load saved data summary table
load("data/data_summary.RData")
load("data/var_type_summary.RData")

# 
library(knitr)
kable(data_summary, caption = "Data Quality Summary")
kable(var_type_summary, caption = "Variable Type Summary")
```


**Variable Types:** <br>

  - Numerical Variables: Game scores, player statistics, team rankings.
  - Categorical Variables: Team names, player names, win/loss indicators.
  - Date Variables: 

**Missingness** <br>

  - The `Games` and `Teams` datasets have minimal missing data (<1%).
  - `Games Details` has 19.62% missing values, mainly due to missing stats for inactive players.
  - `Ranking` has 7.55% missing values, likely due to gaps in ranking updates or teams that did not make the playoffs.

**Data Tidying** <br>

  - `Games Details` needs filtering to remove missing values related to inactive players.
  - `Ranking` dataset should be aligned with playoff results for accurate championship predictions.
  - `Games` dataset has some redundant columns that can be removed to simplify modeling.
  - Date formats should be standardized across datasets.
  - Team and player names should be checked for consistency across datasets.


## Target variable analysis
**Target Variable:** <br>

  - The primary target variable will be `NBA Champion Team`
  - This will be derived this from the `ranking.csv` dataset and final playoff games.

**Distribution Analysis:** <br>

  - The target variable is imbalanced because some teams like the Warriors and Lakers have dominated multiple seasons.
  - I will visualize historical champions and assess team frequency in past seasons.

**Symmetry & Skewness:** <br>



**Missingness:** <br>

  - If any seasons are missing from the `Ranking` dataset, I may need to cross-reference game results to fill in the missing champions.


**Transformations Considered:**
